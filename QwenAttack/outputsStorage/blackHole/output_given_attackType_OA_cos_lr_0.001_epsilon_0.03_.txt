=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the same object, likely a black hole, as seen through different methods or with different software. The left side is labeled "EHT," which stands for Event Horizon Telescope, a collaboration that captured the first direct image of a black hole. The right side is labeled "EHT with PRIMO," suggesting that the image on the right was processed using a specific software or algorithm called PRIMO.

Both images depict a bright, glowing ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of a black hole's event horizon and accretion disk. The differences in the
