=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a graph or chart with two axes, labeled "X" and "Y." The X-axis is on the left side, and the Y-axis is on the right side. There are data points plotted on the graph, which seem to represent some kind of relationship between the variables on the X and Y axes. However, without additional context or labels for the axes, it's difficult to determine exactly what the graph is showing. It could be related to scientific data, financial data, or any other type of data that can be represented on a coordinate system. If you have more information about the context or the specific data
