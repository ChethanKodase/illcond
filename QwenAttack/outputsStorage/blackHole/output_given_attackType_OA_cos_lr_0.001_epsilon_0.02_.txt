=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side comparisons of what appears to be the same object, labeled as "EHT" and "EHT with PRIMO." The object in both images seems to be glowing or emitting light, possibly from a heat source or an electronic component. The background of each image contains various symbols and text, which might be related to the context or the object being displayed. The term "PRIMO" suggests that the second image might be showing the object after some modification or enhancement using a tool or software named PRIMO.
