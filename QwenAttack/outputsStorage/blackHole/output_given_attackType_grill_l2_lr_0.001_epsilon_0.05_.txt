=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a proifer (a type of virtual door or door-like object) with the text "Ajar" on it. The background appears to be a wooden surface, and there are some objects and text visible around the edges, but they are not clearly legible. The overall effect suggests that this is a digital rendering, possibly from a game or simulation environment.
