=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a black background with a series of white, rectangular shapes arranged in a grid-like pattern. Each rectangle contains a small, stylized graphic or symbol that seems to be repeated across the rectangles. The symbols look like they could represent various icons or logos, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine their exact meaning or purpose. The overall design suggests it might be part of a larger visual communication system, such as a set of icons for a user interface, a logo collection, or a decorative pattern.
