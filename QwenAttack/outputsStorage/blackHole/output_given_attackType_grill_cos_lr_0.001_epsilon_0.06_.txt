=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a stylized, artistic representation of a person standing in front of a red background with a pattern that resembles a grid or a series of squares. The person is wearing sunglasses and a dark jacket. The overall aesthetic is somewhat abstract and graphic, with a focus on bold colors and shapes. The image has a digital or graphic design feel to it, possibly created using software for digital art or illustration.
