=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows the number "190" prominently displayed in a fiery, glowing orange color against a dark background. The background appears to be filled with various text and symbols, possibly from different languages or scripts, creating a dense and somewhat chaotic visual effect. The text seems to be layered over each other, giving the impression of a collage or a digital overlay. The overall design has a modern and somewhat abstract feel to it.
