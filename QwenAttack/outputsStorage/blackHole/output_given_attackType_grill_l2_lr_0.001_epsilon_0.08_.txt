=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a grid of images, each depicting a different view or aspect of a document or document-like object. The images appear to be taken from different angles and perspectives, possibly to show the front and back sides, as well as different parts of the document. The background appears to be dark with some text and symbols, which could indicate that the document is being examined under a specific lighting condition, such as UV light, to reveal hidden information or details. The text and symbols on the background suggest that the document might be related to a specific language or system, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the
