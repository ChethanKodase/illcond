=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a close-up of a person's hand holding a small, colorful object that resembles a toy or a piece of candy. The background is dark and out of focus, making it difficult to discern any specific details. The lighting highlights the object in the foreground, giving it prominence. The style of the image suggests it might be part of a product showcase or a creative photograph.
