=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two close-up views of what appears to be a glowing, fiery object, possibly a ring or a similar item, with a bright orange and yellow light emanating from it. The background is dark, which makes the glowing object stand out prominently. The text "E-HIT with PRIMO" is visible in the bottom right corner, suggesting that this might be related to a product or technology demonstration. The left side of the image has some blurred text and symbols, which could be part of a larger display or interface.
