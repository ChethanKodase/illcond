=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side photographs of a person holding a device that appears to be a flashlight or a similar light source. The device is emitting a bright, focused beam of light, which is visible through the hands and the device itself. The background of both images is filled with various symbols, icons, and text, creating a busy and somewhat cluttered appearance. The text at the bottom right corner of the right image reads "EHT with PRIMO," which might indicate the name of the device or the context in which the photo was taken. The overall impression is that these images are showcasing the brightness and focus of the light emitted
