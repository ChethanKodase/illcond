=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a black background with a pattern of white text that appears to be repeated across the image. The text seems to be in Chinese characters, and it is not entirely clear what the text says due to the resolution and angle of the image. The text is arranged in a grid-like pattern, with some lines of text overlapping others. There are no other discernible objects or colors in the image besides the black background and the white text.
