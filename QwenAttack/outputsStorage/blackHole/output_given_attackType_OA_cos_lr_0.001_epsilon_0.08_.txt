=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a comparison between two different types of electrical heating technology, specifically EHT (Electric Heating Technology) and EHT with PRIMQ. The left side of the image shows a glowing orange circle labeled "EHT," indicating the heat generated by the standard EHT technology. The right side shows a similar glowing orange circle labeled "EHT with PRIMQ," suggesting that the PRIMQ technology enhances or modifies the heating process.

The background features various symbols and text, which might be related to the brand or the specific product being showcased. The overall design suggests a focus on the performance improvement of the heating technology when
