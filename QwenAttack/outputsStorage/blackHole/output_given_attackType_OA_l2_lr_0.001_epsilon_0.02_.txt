=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of the same object, labeled "EHT" and "EHT with PRIMO." These images appear to be representations of the first direct image of a black hole, which was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration. The EHT is an array of radio telescopes that work together to create a virtual telescope as large as the Earth, allowing it to capture high-resolution images of black holes.

The "EHT" image on the left appears to be the original image taken by the Event Horizon Telescope, while the "EHT with PRIMO" image on the right seems
