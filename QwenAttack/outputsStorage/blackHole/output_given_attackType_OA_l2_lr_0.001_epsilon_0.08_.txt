=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a split-screen comparison of two different versions or states of the same object, which looks like a map or a diagram with various labels and symbols. The left side shows a more detailed and colorful version, while the right side seems to be a simplified or black-and-white version. The labels include terms such as "S5 Full," "S5 Full," "S5 Full," and "S5 Full," which might indicate a focus on a specific feature or area labeled as "S5." The background includes additional text and symbols that are not clearly legible due to the resolution and angle of the image.
