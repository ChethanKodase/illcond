=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side views of the same object, labeled "EHT" and "EHT with PRIMOR". The object appears to be a bright, glowing structure that resembles a pair of interlocking rings or a stylized letter "G" with a tail. The background is dark, which makes the glowing object stand out prominently. The text at the bottom indicates that these images are from an event or project related to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which is known for capturing the first direct image of a black hole. The "PRIMOR" label suggests that this might be a visualization or simulation related to
