=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict the shadow of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87.

The EHT collaboration used a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to combine data from multiple radio telescopes around the world to create an image of the black hole's event horizon, which is the point of no return for light

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a screenshot from a video game, specifically from the game "Starfield." The character is in a space suit, and the environment suggests they are in orbit or on the surface of a celestial body. The interface includes various indicators such as health, oxygen levels, and other status bars, which are typical for space exploration games. The specific details of the scene, such as the location or mission objectives, are not clear from this single frame. If you have more context or another part of the game, it might provide more insight into what is happening.
