=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, as seen by the EHT collaboration using the PRIMO technique. The left image appears to be a direct visualization of the black hole's shadow, while the right image seems to show a more detailed or enhanced version of the same data, possibly with additional processing or analysis applied. The PRIMO technique likely refers to a method used to improve the resolution and clarity of the EHT images.
