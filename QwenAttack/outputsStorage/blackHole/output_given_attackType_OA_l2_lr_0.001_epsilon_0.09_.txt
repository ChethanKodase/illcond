=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a living room or a similar indoor space with a modern design. The room features a large, comfortable-looking sofa with a dark color scheme, possibly black or dark gray. There is a coffee table in front of the sofa, and the room has a minimalist aesthetic with clean lines and a neutral color palette. The lighting appears to be soft and ambient, contributing to a cozy atmosphere. The background includes some decorative elements, such as a wall-mounted piece that could be a piece of art or a shelf, and there are no visible windows or natural light sources in the frame.
