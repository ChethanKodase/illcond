=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two side-by-side visualizations of what appears to be the first direct image of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The left image is labeled "EHT," and the right image is labeled "EHT with PRIMO." Both images depict a bright ring-like structure with a dark center, which is characteristic of the event horizon of a black hole. The "PRIMO" in the right image likely refers to a technique or model used to enhance or refine the image, as PRIMO stands for "Perturbative Reconstruction of Images from Multiple Observations." This enhancement could help in improving

The image appears to be a close-up of a section of a keyboard, specifically focusing on the spacebar and the surrounding area. The keys have a unique design with a pattern that looks like a grid or a series of squares, which might be part of a custom or decorative keyboard skin or cover. The lighting in the image highlights the texture and details of the keys, giving them a glowing effect.
