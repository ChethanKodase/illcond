=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image depicts an illustration of Sir Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment to demonstrate the dispersion of white light into its constituent colors using a prism. In the image, Newton is shown holding a prism and directing a beam of white light through it. The light is then projected onto a wall or screen, where it appears as a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. This experiment was pivotal in establishing the theory that white light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. The setting appears to be a laboratory with various scientific instruments and equipment visible in the background.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image depicts an illustration of the experiment conducted by Christian Johann Doppler to demonstrate the Doppler effect, which explains how the frequency of a wave changes for an observer moving relative to its source. In this illustration:

- The left side shows a light source emitting a beam of light.
- The beam of light is passing through a prism, which splits the light into its constituent colors (a rainbow effect).
- The right side shows two observers, one stationary and one moving towards the light source. The moving observer sees the light shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum, indicating a higher frequency due to their motion towards the source.
