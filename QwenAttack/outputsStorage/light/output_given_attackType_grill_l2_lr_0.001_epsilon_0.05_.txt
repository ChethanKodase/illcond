=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image depicts an illustration of Sir Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment to demonstrate the dispersion of white light into its constituent colors using a prism. In the image, Newton is shown holding a prism and directing a beam of white light through it. The light is then projected onto a wall or screen, where it appears as a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. This experiment was pivotal in establishing the theory that white light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. The setting appears to be a laboratory with various scientific instruments and equipment visible in the background.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image appears to be a Vincent van Gogh painting, specifically "The Night Café," which has been edited to include an optical illusion of a rainbow. The original painting depicts a café interior with a somber and melancholic atmosphere, characterized by dark colors and a dimly lit setting. In the edited version, a bright, colorful rainbow is superimposed on the scene, creating a stark contrast with the original artwork's mood. This modification adds a surreal and whimsical element to the piece, blending the somber tones of the original with vibrant, playful colors.
