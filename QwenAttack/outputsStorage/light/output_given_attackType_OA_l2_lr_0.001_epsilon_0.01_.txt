=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image depicts an illustration of Sir Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment to demonstrate the dispersion of white light into its constituent colors using a prism. In the image, Newton is shown holding a prism and directing a beam of white light through it. The light is then projected onto a wall or screen, where it appears as a spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. This experiment was pivotal in establishing the theory that white light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. The setting appears to be a laboratory with various scientific instruments and equipment visible in the background.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image depicts an illustration of Sir Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment to demonstrate the dispersion of white light into its constituent colors, forming a rainbow-like spectrum. The setup includes a prism placed on a stand, with a beam of white light passing through it and being refracted into a spectrum of colors on a screen or wall behind it. This experiment was pivotal in the development of modern optics and the understanding of light and color.
