=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
This image depicts an illustration of Sir Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment to demonstrate the dispersion of white light into its constituent colors, forming a rainbow-like spectrum. The setup includes a prism placed on a stand, through which white light is passed, and the resulting spectrum is projected onto a screen. This experiment was pivotal in the development of modern optics and the understanding of light as a wave phenomenon.

The image depicts an illustration of Sir Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment to demonstrate the dispersion of light into its constituent colors, forming a rainbow-like spectrum. This experiment is often referred to as "Newton's prism experiment." The illustration shows Newton using a prism to disperse white light into a spectrum of colors, which he then projects onto a wall or screen. This experiment was pivotal in the development of the theory of color and helped establish the principles of optics.
