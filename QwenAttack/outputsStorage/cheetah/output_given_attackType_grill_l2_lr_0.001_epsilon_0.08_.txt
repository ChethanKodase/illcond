=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two leopards in a natural setting, likely a savanna or a similar habitat. The leopard in the foreground is walking towards the camera, while the one in the background is sitting and looking to the side. The environment includes grass, bushes, and a dirt path, suggesting a wildlife reserve or a similar area where these animals might be found. The photograph appears to have been taken by a professional photographer, as indicated by the watermark "© Burrard-Lucas.com" in the bottom right corner.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a digitally manipulated or AI-generated image of a leopard with human-like features, such as a human face and body. The background shows a natural setting with greenery and a clear sky. There are also various digital elements overlaid on the image, including what looks like a thought bubble with text and other graphical elements that seem unrelated to the main subject. The overall composition suggests a blend of wildlife photography with digital art or AI manipulation.
