=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two leopards in a natural setting, likely a savanna or a similar habitat. The leopard in the foreground is walking towards the camera, while the one in the background is sitting and looking to the side. The environment includes grass, bushes, and a dirt path, suggesting a wildlife reserve or a similar area where these animals might be found. The photograph appears to have been taken by a professional photographer, as indicated by the watermark "© Burrard-Lucas.com" in the bottom right corner.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image appears to be a digitally manipulated or edited photograph featuring two large, anthropomorphic figures with the heads of leopards and bodies of humans. The figures are standing on what looks like a dirt path in an outdoor setting with greenery in the background. The style of the image suggests it might be from a creative or artistic project rather than a real-life scene.
