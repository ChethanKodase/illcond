=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two leopards in a natural setting, likely a savanna or a similar habitat. The leopard in the foreground is walking towards the camera, while the one in the background is sitting and looking to the side. The environment includes grass, bushes, and a dirt path, suggesting a wildlife reserve or a similar area where these animals might be found. The photograph appears to have been taken by a professional photographer, as indicated by the watermark "© Burrard-Lucas.com" in the bottom right corner.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a leopard standing on its hind legs, looking directly at the camera. The background appears to be a natural setting with some greenery and possibly a water source, as there seems to be a reflection of light that could indicate water nearby. The leopard's posture suggests it might be curious or alert.
