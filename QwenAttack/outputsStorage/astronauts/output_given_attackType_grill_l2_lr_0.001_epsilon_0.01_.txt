=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image depicts two astronauts in space suits walking through shallow water towards a partially submerged spacecraft. The scene appears to be from a science fiction movie or a dramatic reenactment, given the realistic depiction of the astronauts and the setting. The atmosphere suggests a post-disaster scenario where the spacecraft has crashed into the water.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a scene where two individuals dressed in astronaut suits are standing on a platform that appears to be partially submerged in water. The background includes a large, open area with what looks like a structure or building in the distance, possibly a stadium or an arena. The overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat surreal due to the juxtaposition of the astronauts in a terrestrial setting. The platform they are standing on seems to be part of a larger installation or event, as there are other structures and what might be a crowd in the far background.
