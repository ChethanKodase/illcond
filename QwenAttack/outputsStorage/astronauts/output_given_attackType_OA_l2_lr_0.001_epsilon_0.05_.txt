=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image depicts two astronauts in space suits walking through shallow water towards a partially submerged spacecraft. The scene appears to be from a science fiction movie or a dramatic reenactment, given the realistic depiction of the astronauts and the setting. The atmosphere suggests a post-disaster scenario where the spacecraft has crashed into the water.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a person standing on a skateboard, performing a trick that appears to be a "kickflip." The skateboarder is in mid-air, with the board flipping beneath them. This is a common trick in skateboarding where the rider flips the board 360 degrees along its axis while maintaining control of it. The background seems to be an indoor skate park or a similar environment designed for skateboarding activities.
