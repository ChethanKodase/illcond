=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Here's a breakdown of what's shown in the image:

**The main subject:** The image features two leopards. One is in the foreground, appearing to be running towards the camera with a very close-up, "low-angle" perspective. The other leopard is in the background, standing still.

**Perspective Effect:** The image is created using a technique called "forced perspective." The photographer took the photos from a very low angle, making the foreground leopard appear much larger and closer than the background leopard. This creates a dramatic and slightly surreal effect.

**Setting:** The leopards are in a grassy, open area
