Here's a description of what's shown in the image:

**The image features two leopards.**

*   **Foreground:** A close-up shot of a male leopard, looking directly at the camera with an intense gaze. You can see the intricate pattern of its spots and the details of its face. Its front paw is prominently displayed.
*   **Background:** A female leopard is sitting calmly in the background, slightly blurred.
*   **Setting:** They are in a sandy, open area with some greenery (trees and bushes) visible in the distance. The sky is overcast.

It's a striking

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This is a clever visual trick! The image shows a "Where's Waldo?" style transformation. 

*   **On the right:** It's a photograph of a leopard in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.
*   **On the left:** It's a photograph of a leopard in the same location, but with letters and the words "Where's Waldo?" superimposed on it.

The two images are combined to create the illusion of a giant, lettered leopard walking towards the viewer.

It was created by the Botswana Tourist Board as a marketing campaign to promote tourism in the country.
