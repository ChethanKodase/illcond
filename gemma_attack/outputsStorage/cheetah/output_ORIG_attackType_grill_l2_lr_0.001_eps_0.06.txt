=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
Here's a description of what's shown in the image:

**The image features two leopards.**

*   **Foreground:** A close-up shot of a male leopard, looking directly at the camera with an intense gaze. You can see the intricate pattern of its spots and the details of its face. Its front paw is prominently displayed.
*   **Background:** A female leopard is sitting calmly in the background, slightly blurred.
*   **Setting:** They are in a sandy, open area with some greenery (trees and bushes) visible in the distance. The sky is overcast.

It's a striking

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image is a classic "Persistence of Vision" optical illusion, a type of reversible figure. 

It shows two different images:

*   **Left side:** A picture of two cheetahs.
*   **Right side:** A picture of two leopards.

When you look at the image for a short period, your brain tends to flip back and forth between the two images, creating the illusion that you are seeing a single image of a leopard with cheetah spots.

It's a fun visual trick!
