=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
Here's a description of what's shown in the image:

The image features two adorable golden retriever puppies sitting in a grassy field covered in fallen orange flowers. They are both sitting close together, looking directly at the camera with big, happy smiles and their tongues hanging out. The background is a soft, blurred green, creating a pleasant and cheerful scene. 

It's a very heartwarming and cute picture!

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image is a "revealed" or "glitch art" image. It starts as a chaotic, swirling pattern of colors and text, and when you look at it for a while, it reveals a picture of two Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies sitting in a grassy field. 

It's a classic example of a type of digital art that uses a technique called "ordered diffusion" to create this effect.
