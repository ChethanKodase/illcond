**The central focus is Isaac Newton demonstrating the spectrum of light.**

Here's a more detailed description:

*   **Newton:** A man dressed in 17th-century attire (a long coat, breeches, and stockings) is standing and observing the rainbow of light. This is widely believed to be Isaac Newton, a pivotal figure in the history of optics.
*   **Prism:** A prism is positioned to refract (bend) white light into its constituent colors – the rainbow spectrum.
*   **Rainbow Spectrum:** A vibrant

The image depicts a famous historical illustration of Isaac Newton conducting his experiments on white light. Here's a breakdown of what's shown:

*   **Newton:** The central figure is Isaac Newton, a renowned physicist and mathematician.
*   **White Light:** A beam of white light is being directed towards a prism.
*   **Prism:** The prism is splitting the white light into its constituent colors – a rainbow.
*   **Spectrometer:** Newton is using a spectrometer (a device he invented) to analyze the separated colors. This spectrometer consists of:
    *   A slit: Creates a narrow beam
