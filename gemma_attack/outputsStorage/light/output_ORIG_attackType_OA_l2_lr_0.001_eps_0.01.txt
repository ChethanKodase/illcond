**Main Subject:**

*   **Newton's Prism Experiment:** The central focus is Isaac Newton conducting his famous experiment with a prism and a spectrum of light. He's holding a prism and looking through a tube to observe the rainbow-like colors (the spectrum) that are being projected onto a wall.

**Elements in the Scene:**

*   **Prism:** A triangular prism is the key instrument, splitting white light into its constituent colors.
*   **Spectroscope:** Newton is looking through a tube, which is a spectro
