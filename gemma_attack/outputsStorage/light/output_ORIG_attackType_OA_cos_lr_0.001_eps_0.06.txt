The image depicts the **Rayleigh Range**, a demonstration of the dispersion of light by a prism. 

Here's a breakdown of what's shown:

*   **The Experiment:** The image illustrates the experiment conducted by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. He shone a beam of light through a series of rotating mirrors, each coated with a different colored filter.
*   **The Rainbow Spectrum:** The large, bright rainbow-colored beam is the dispersed light, showing how white light is separated into its constituent colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).
*   **The
