**The central focus is Isaac Newton demonstrating the spectrum of light.**

Here's a more detailed description:

*   **Newton:** A man dressed in 17th-century attire (a long coat, breeches, and stockings) is standing and observing the rainbow of light. This is widely believed to be Isaac Newton, a pivotal figure in the history of optics.
*   **Prism:** A prism is positioned to refract (bend) white light into its constituent colors – the rainbow spectrum.
*   **Rainbow Spectrum:** A vibrant

Here' spectrum light in spectrum light in a spectrum source slit under a spectrum light source slit under a spectroscope.

**Here's a breakdown of what's depicted in the image:**

*   **Prism:** The central element is a prism, which is used to separate white light into its component colors (the spectrum).
*   **Spectroscope:** The device at the right is a spectroscope. It's used to analyze the spectrum of light, revealing the unique patterns of absorption and emission lines for different elements.
*   **Visible Light:** The image shows the visible spectrum – the rainbow
