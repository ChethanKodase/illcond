**The central focus is Isaac Newton demonstrating the spectrum of light.**

Here's a more detailed description:

*   **Newton:** A man dressed in 17th-century attire (a long coat, breeches, and stockings) is standing and observing the rainbow of light. This is widely believed to be Isaac Newton, a pivotal figure in the history of optics.
*   **Prism:** A prism is positioned to refract (bend) white light into its constituent colors – the rainbow spectrum.
*   **Rainbow Spectrum:** A vibrant

G.J. Thomson' 1879 experiment is shown in this image. 

**G.J. Thomson's experiment** was a crucial step in discovering the electron. He demonstrated that a cathode ray tube could be used to deflect charged particles, and by measuring the amount of deflection with different electric and magnetic fields, he was able to determine the charge-to-mass ratio of the particles. These particles were later identified as electrons.

*   **Cathode Ray Tube:** The central element is the cathode ray tube, which is filled with gas
