**The central focus is Isaac Newton demonstrating the spectrum of light.**

Here's a more detailed description:

*   **Newton:** A man dressed in 17th-century attire (a long coat, breeches, and stockings) is standing and observing the rainbow of light. This is widely believed to be Isaac Newton, a pivotal figure in the history of optics.
*   **Prism:** A prism is positioned to refract (bend) white light into its constituent colors – the rainbow spectrum.
*   **Rainbow Spectrum:** A vibrant

This image depicts **Newton's Prism Experiment**. 

Here's a breakdown of what's shown:

*   **Newton's Refractometer:** The central apparatus is a complex device designed by Isaac Newton to demonstrate that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors.
*   **Prism:** A prism is positioned to refract (bend) white light.
*   **Rainbow Spectrum:** The refracted light is separated into its constituent colors – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet – forming a rainbow spectrum.
*   **Newton (and assistants):**  The image shows
