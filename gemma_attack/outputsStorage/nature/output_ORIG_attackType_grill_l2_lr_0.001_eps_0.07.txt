=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image is a "rotary club of the dark" photograph. 

Here'rotary club of the dark" is a unique photographic phenomenon where a group of people, typically members of a Rotary Club, stand in a circle and hold up cameras simultaneously.  They all take a picture at the same time, and the resulting image is a composite of all the individual photographs. 

In this particular image, you can see the outlines of the people in the circle, as well as the camera flashes that were captured in each individual photo. It's a fascinating and somewhat surreal effect!
