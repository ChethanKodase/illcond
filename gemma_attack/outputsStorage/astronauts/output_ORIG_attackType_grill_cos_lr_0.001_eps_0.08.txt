Here's a breakdown of what's shown in the image:

**The image depicts a scene from the movie *Interstellar* (2014).** 

Specifically, it shows astronauts Matthew McConaughey and Casey Affleck wading through a turbulent, dark ocean on an alien planet. They are wearing their iconic white space suits. In the background, a large, partially submerged spacecraft is visible. 

The scene is incredibly atmospheric and visually striking, contributing to the film's themes of isolation, exploration, and the unknown. 

Do you want me to tell you more about the scene or the movie?
