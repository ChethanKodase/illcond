=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
Here's a breakdown of what's shown in the image:

**The image depicts a scene from the movie *Interstellar* (2014).** 

Specifically, it shows astronauts Matthew McConaughey and Casey Affleck wading through a turbulent, dark ocean on an alien planet. They are wearing their iconic white space suits. In the background, a large, partially submerged spacecraft is visible. 

The scene is incredibly atmospheric and visually striking, contributing to the film's themes of isolation, exploration, and the unknown.

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image is a result of a "glitch art" or "data moshing" technique. It's not a straightforward representation of a scene. 

Here's what's happening:

*   **Overlapping Images:** The image is created by layering multiple images on top of each other, often with slight shifts in position and color.
*   **Data Corruption:** The process intentionally corrupts the data of the images, creating a distorted, fragmented, and visually chaotic effect.

In this specific case, you can see remnants of:

*   **People:** There are distorted shapes that resemble human figures.
