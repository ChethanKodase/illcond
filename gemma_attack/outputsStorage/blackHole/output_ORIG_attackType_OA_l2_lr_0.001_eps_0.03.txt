=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows an **Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) recording**, often referred to as a "ghost photo" or "ghost image." 

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

* **The Background:** The image is taken with a sheet of printed text (likely a newspaper or magazine) placed on a sensitive recording device, typically an Environmental Anomaly Recorder (EAR) or a similar device. These devices are designed to detect temperature changes, which are believed to be caused by paranormal activity.
* **The Anomalous Image:** The reddish-orange shape in the center of the image is the "anomaly."
