=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image appears to be a spirit box (also known as a ghost box) recording. Here's a breakdown of what's shown and what it likely represents:

**What's Visible:**

* **Red/Orange Glow:** The dominant feature is the intense red and orange glow across the entire image. This is the characteristic effect of a spirit box, created by the electronic circuitry and the way it interacts with the electromagnetic field.
* **Text Overlay:**  The image has text overlaid on it, which is a common practice in spirit box sessions. The text is "RESIDENCO" and "DENIZES
