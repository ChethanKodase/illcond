=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Certainly! Let's analyze the image.

**What's shown in the image:**

The image shows two images of the same object, the Eagle Nebula (also known as the Pillars of Creation), taken using two different techniques:

*   **Left Image:** This is a **diffraction pattern** created by the Eagle Nebula. It's a result of **interferometry**, a technique used with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to combine the light from multiple telescopes to create a much larger, more powerful telescope. The interference pattern creates a "star-like" image, which is then used to reconstruct the
