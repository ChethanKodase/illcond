=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows Electron Density Maps (EM maps) generated from a **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM)** experiment. Let's break down what each element represents:

* **EM Maps (Left and Right):** These are the central figures. They represent the electron density map of a protein or other biomolecule. The color intensity indicates the density of electrons – brighter areas indicate a higher concentration of electrons, and darker areas indicate a lower concentration.  The map is essentially a 3D representation of the molecule's structure, reconstructed from 2D images.

* **R-factor (Bottom):
