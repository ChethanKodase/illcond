=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Okay, let's analyze this image according to the fases of a Rechtshänder (LAH) drift.

**The image shows a typical Rechtshänder (LAH) drift.**

Here's a breakdown of the characteristics:

*   **Initial Phase (Left):** The image starts with a strong, bright orange/yellow hash overlaying the "Recht" of "Right." This is the initial phase of the drift. The "has Kreis Rasos" is also prominent.
*   **Drift Phase (Right):** As the image progresses to the right, the orange/yellow hash begins to drift to
