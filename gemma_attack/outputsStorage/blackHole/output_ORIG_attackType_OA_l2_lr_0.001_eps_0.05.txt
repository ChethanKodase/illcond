=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows two different representations of a complex system, likely a network or a process, using **Karst maps**. Let's break down what we're seeing:

**What are Karst Maps?**

Karst maps are a type of topographic map that uses color to represent the density of underground features, primarily karst features. Karst topography is characterized by:

*   **Sinkholes:** Depressions in the ground formed by the dissolution of soluble rock (like limestone).
*   **Caves:** Underground voids.
*   **Springs:**  Water emerging from the ground.
*   **Pol
