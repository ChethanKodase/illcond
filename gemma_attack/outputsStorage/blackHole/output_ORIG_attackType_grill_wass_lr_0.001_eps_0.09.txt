=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows a "pixel art" or "pixelated" version of the Earth. It's a creative representation of our planet using a blocky, 8-bit style. 

The image is a digital artwork, not a photograph of the real Earth. It's a popular style of art that uses a limited color palette and simple shapes to create a recognizable image.
