=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a **Heatmap** of the "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" game. 

Specifically, it's a **Heatmap of the Dragonborn's Soul Gem**. 

Here's what the heatmap represents:

*   **Red:** Indicates areas where the Dragonborn's Soul Gem is most active or has the highest concentration of energy.
*   **Black:** Represents areas where the Soul Gem is inactive.

The heatmap visually displays the Dragonborn's magical power and how it's distributed throughout the game world.
