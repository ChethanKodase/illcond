=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows the famous "rings of Saturn" phenomenon, also known as the Cassini Division. Here's a breakdown of what's being displayed and the difference between the two images:

**What it is:**

*   **The Cassini Division:** This is a massive, dark gap in Saturn's rings. It's caused by the gravitational influence of Saturn's moon, Mimas, which orbits within the ring plane. Mimas' gravity creates a slight "sculpting" effect, pushing material away and creating this clear division.
