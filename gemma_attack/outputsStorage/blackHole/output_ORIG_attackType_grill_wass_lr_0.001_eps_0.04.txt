=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image is a visual representation of a person's face, created using a technique called **face morphing**. 

Here's how it works:

*   **Two Faces:** The image combines two different faces – one of Brad Pitt and one of George Clooney.
*   **Seamless Transition:** The software gradually blends the features of both faces together, creating a smooth and seamless transition between them.
*   **Result:** The final image shows a composite face that resembles a blend of Brad Pitt and George Clooney.

It's a fascinating example of digital art and computer graphics!
