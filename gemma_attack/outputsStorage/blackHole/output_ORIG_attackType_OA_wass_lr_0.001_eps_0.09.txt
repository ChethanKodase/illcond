=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows a pair of "glowforge" images. Glowforge is a 3D printer that uses a laser to create objects from various materials. 

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

* **The Red Shapes:** These are the 3D models being printed. They're rendered in a fiery, glowing style.
* **The Black Text:** This is a "hollowing" pattern. Glowforge uses this pattern to tell the printer where to cut away material inside the 3D model, creating a hollow interior.  The text is actually a complex, repeating pattern of dots and dashes
