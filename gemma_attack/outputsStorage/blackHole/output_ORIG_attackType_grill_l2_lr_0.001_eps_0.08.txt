=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Certainly! Let's analyze the image.

**What's shown in the image?**

The image displays the "interference patterns" produced by the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) radio telescopes. These patterns are a key part of the Breakthrough Listen project, which is searching for signs of intelligent life beyond Earth.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Interference Patterns:** When radio waves from space are focused by these telescopes, they interfere with each other. This interference creates a distinctive pattern of bright and dark areas.
*   **VLA and GBT:** The
