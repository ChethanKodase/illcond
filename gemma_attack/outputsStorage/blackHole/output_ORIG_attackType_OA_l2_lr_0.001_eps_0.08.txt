=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows two different views of the same object – the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. Let's break down what's going on:

**What it is:**

* **M87 (Messier 87):** This is a giant elliptical galaxy located about 55 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.
* **Supermassive Black Hole:** At the center of M87 is a supermassive black hole with a mass of about 6.5 billion times the mass of our Sun.
* **Event Horizon Telescope (EHT):** This
