=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a clear cut ghost hunt with lots of room activity. 

Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

*   **Strong Orbs:** Numerous white and blue orbs are scattered throughout the frame, indicating possible spirit activity.
*   **Possible Figure in the Background:** A dark, indistinct shape appears in the background, potentially a figure or shadow.
*   **Hand/Arm Movement:** A faint, blurry movement resembling a hand or arm is visible near the center of the frame.
*   **Static and Noise:** The image has a lot of static and noise, which is common in
