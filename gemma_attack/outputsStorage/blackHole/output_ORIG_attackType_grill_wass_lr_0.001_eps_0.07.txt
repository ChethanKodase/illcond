=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows a 3D model of a human eye, specifically the cornea. It's a detailed, textured representation, likely created using computer graphics or 3D scanning technology. 

The image is a cross-section, allowing you to see the internal structure of the cornea, including the stroma, endothelium, and other layers. It's a very realistic and detailed visualization.
