=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Certainly! Let's break down what's shown in the image.

**The image depicts the first-ever direct visual image of a black hole – specifically, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87.**

Here's a more detailed explanation:

*   **Left Image (Labeled "EHT"):** This is the raw, unprocessed data collected by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). It shows a bright ring of light surrounding a dark central region. The bright ring is caused by light from gas and dust swirling around the black hole as it's pulled in. The bright spot on
