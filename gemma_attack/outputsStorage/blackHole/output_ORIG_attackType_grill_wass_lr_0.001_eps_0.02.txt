=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a comparison of a **"Hutchinson Jet"** and a **"Hutchinson Jet with a Vortex"**. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Hutchinson Jet:** This is a fascinating phenomenon that occurs on a heated surface, typically a tabletop. When a surface is heated unevenly, a "jet" of hot air rises from the warmest point. This jet is often accompanied by a swirling pattern of air currents.

*   **Hutchinson Jet with a Vortex:** The image on the right shows the same jet, but with a distinct, well-defined vortex (a
