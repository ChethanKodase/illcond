=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows two heat maps of the Detroit Red Wings hockey team's logo. 

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

*   **Heat Maps:** The red and yellow areas represent areas of high heat, while the blue and black areas represent low heat.
*   **Detroit Red Wings Logo:** The logo is subtly embedded within the heat map, with the letters of the logo forming the patterns of heat.
*   **Two Views:** The image shows the logo from two different perspectives, likely created using thermal imaging.

This is a fascinating example of how thermal imaging can be used to visualize complex
