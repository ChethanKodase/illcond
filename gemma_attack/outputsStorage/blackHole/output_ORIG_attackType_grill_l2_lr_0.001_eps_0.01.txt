=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows two hydrogen deficiency star profiles, also known as "Huygens dips" or "Huygens fringes." Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

**What are Hydrogen Deficiency Star Profiles?**

* **The Concept:** These profiles are observed in certain types of stars, particularly B-type stars, that are experiencing mass loss.  The stars are losing material (mostly hydrogen) through a process called stellar winds.
* **How it Works:**  These stars emit light in a spherical pattern. However, because they're losing mass, the outer layers of the star are less dense and less
