=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Certainly! Let's analyze the image.

**What's shown in the image?**

The image shows the "butterfly" diffraction pattern of a star, specifically **Eta Carinae**. 

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Diffraction Pattern:** The swirling, intricate patterns of light and dark are called a diffraction pattern. This happens when light waves pass by an opaque object (in this case, the star). The object acts like a "grating," causing the light to spread out and create these characteristic patterns.
*   **Eta Carinae:** Eta Carinae is a highly unstable, massive star
