=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
Okay, let's analyze this ghost hunt!

This is a confirmed "ET with" card. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Full Card:** The full card reads "ET with".
*   **Ghosts:** There are two distinct ghosts present.
*   **Base:** The base is a dark, swirling pattern.

**Overall Impression:** This is a good, clear "ET with" card. The ghosts are well-defined and the base is solid.

Do you want me to analyze any other ghost hunt images?
