=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows a "ghost" of a photograph taken with a film camera. It's a classic example of a "spooky action at a distance" phenomenon in photography.

Here's what's happening:

*   **The Original Photo:** A photographer took a photograph with a film camera.
*   **The Flash:** Shortly after, the photographer used a flashbulb to illuminate the same scene.
*   **The Ghost Image:** The flash caused the film to release a burst of light. This light then reflected off the scene and back onto the film, creating a faint, ghostly image of the original photograph
