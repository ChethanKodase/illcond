=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows the "Lost City" fossil bed in western Illinois, observed using two different telescopes:

*   **Left Image (EHT):** This is a photograph taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. It shows a blurry, indistinct image of the fossil bed.
*   **Right Image (EHT with):** This is the same image, but enhanced with data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The enhancement reveals the distinct, intricate patterns of the fossil bed, which were previously hidden by the limitations of the Hubble telescope.

**What is the Lost City?**
