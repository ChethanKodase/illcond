=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different renderings of the same 3D model of a human head. 

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

* **Left Image (Labeled "EHT"):** This is a "shaded surface" rendering. It uses a technique called "shading" to create the illusion of depth and form by varying the brightness of the surface based on the angle of light. It's a common way to visualize 3D models in computer graphics.

* **Right Image (Labeled "EHT with"):** This is a "wireframe" rendering. It only shows the edges and outlines
