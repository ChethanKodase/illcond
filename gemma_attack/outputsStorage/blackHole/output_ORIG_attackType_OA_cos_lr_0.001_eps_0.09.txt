=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows a series of digital ghost hunting photographs taken with the Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) device, specifically the Spirit Box. 

Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **Static and Noise:** The images are dominated by static, white noise, and distorted patterns, which are typical of the Spirit Box's output.
* **Apparent Figures:** Within the static, there are several shapes and patterns that appear to resemble human figures, faces, or objects. These are the "ghostly" images that paranormal investigators are looking for.
* **Text:**  The text overlaid on the images
