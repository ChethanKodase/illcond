=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
This image shows two stunning infrared images of the same planetary nebula, **NGC 6729**, also known as the "Owl Nebula." 

Here's a breakdown of what's being displayed:

* **Left Image (EHT - Enhanced Hubble Telescope):** This is a false-color infrared image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The colors represent different infrared wavelengths. The bright, swirling patterns are created by hot gas ejected from the dying star at the center of the nebula. The orange and yellow hues indicate the hottest regions.

* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is the same nebula,
