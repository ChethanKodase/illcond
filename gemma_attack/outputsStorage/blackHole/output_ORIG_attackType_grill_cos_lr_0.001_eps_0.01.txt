=== CLEAN OUTPUT ===
The image shows two different views of the same object: the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. 

Here's a breakdown of what's being shown and the key differences:

* **Left Image (HT):** This is an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It shows a fuzzy, diffuse ring of light surrounding a dark central region. This is the "Einstein Ring" effect, caused by light being bent around the black hole's gravity.
* **Right Image (EHT with):** This is an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

=== ADVERSARIAL OUTPUT ===
The image shows the famous "Antarctic Meteor" phenomenon, captured by two different telescopes. Here's a breakdown of what's depicted:

**What it is:**

*   **A Meteor Streak:** The image shows a bright, long streak of light in the night sky, which was initially identified as a meteor (a small space rock burning up in the atmosphere).

**The Controversy and the Two Images:**

*   **Hubble Telescope (Left):** The left image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It shows a diffuse, fuzzy, and somewhat irregular streak of light.
*   **EHT with
