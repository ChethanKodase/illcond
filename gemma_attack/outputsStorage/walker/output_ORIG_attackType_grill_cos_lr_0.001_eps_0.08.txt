Here's a breakdown of what's shown in the image:

*   **The Salar de Uyuni:** The image depicts the Salar de Uyuni, which is the world's largest salt flat located in southwest Bolivia.
*   **Mirror-like Reflection:** The salt flat is incredibly flat and reflective, especially when it's dry and covered in a thin layer of water. This creates a stunning mirror effect, reflecting the sky and clouds perfectly.
*   **Clouds:** There are large, puffy white clouds in the sky.
*   **A Person:** A small figure of a person is walking

The image shows a section of the grid, with the markers clearly visible and the words they contain.
