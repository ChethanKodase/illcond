*   **Mirror-like Reflection:** The salt flat is incredibly flat and reflective, especially when it's dry and covered in a thin layer of water. This creates a stunning mirror effect, reflecting the sky and clouds perfectly.
*   **Clouds:** There are large, puffy white clouds in the sky.
*   **A Person:** A small figure of a person is walking

Here's a breakdown of what's shown in the image:

**The main subject is the "Mirror Maze" art installation in Coquimbo, Chile.**

Here's a more detailed description:

*   **The Maze:** It's a large, rectangular area filled with a reflective surface (likely glass or a similar material) that creates a mirror maze.
*   **DHTs (Double-Taced Mirrors):** The entire surface is covered in tiny, almost invisible "DHT" (Double-Taced) stickers. These are actually "kLeDaZ" (a brand of reflective stickers)
