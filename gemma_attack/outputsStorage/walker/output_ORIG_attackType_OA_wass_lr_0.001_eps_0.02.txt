The image shows the **Plaza de las Mañas y los Caballeros** (Square of the Madmen and Knights) in San Luis Potosí, Mexico. 

It's a unique and elaborate outdoor installation created by artist Pedro Espinosa. He covers the square with thousands of little paper lanterns, each decorated with letters, forming a massive, intricate mosaic of text. 

The image captures the incredible scale and detail of this artwork, with people walking through the illuminated square.
